# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

This code is missing the `(element) => {printDouble(element)}` portion that should be included within the `.forEach` parameters. 

# Teacher Feedback

If you notice, the callback function is actually well defined on the first line! This is not what was wrong with the code! The problem with the code is that the callback function is being invoked within the `forEach`!
