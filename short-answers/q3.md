# Question
What is wrong with this code?

```js
const printDouble = (num) => console.log(num * 2);
const nums = [1,2,3];
nums.forEach(printDouble());
```

# Answer

This code is missing the `(element) => {printDouble(element)}` portion that should be included within the `.forEach` parameters.

`For resubmission:` So removing the `()` that's within the forEach parameter would be the change that's needed? 

`Looking back`~ I think what I might've happened was that I didn't look at the code carefully enough and went on to making assumptions; because now I can see myself reading line 5 and not seeing it as a callback function, but just as a regular old function.

~~If you notice, the callback function is actually well defined on the first line! This is not what was wrong with the code! The problem with the code is that the callback function is being invoked within the `forEach`!~~

~~Score: 1/3~~

Love your observations! Keep in mind that a callback function is a regular function! The only difference is that it is a function that gets passed into a higher order function or method as seen here!
